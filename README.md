# Agora - Task list
Agora is a little todo list app made in React Native for practicing its main basic features.

## Installing and running

> ### Requirements:
> To execute the project, you need to have installed NodeJS, its package manager NPM, and Expo Go (if you want to execute it on an Android device) or a phone emulator (if you will run it on a computer).

If you want to test the app out, you can download its source code here on Github. The steps are following:

1. First of all, you must clone or download the repository;
2. After that, in the root of the downloaded folder, install the node dependencies with NPM:

```
npm install
```

3. Once that's over, you are free to run the project with:

```
npm start
```

4. To access the running project, you are going to need either to scan the QR code with your phone (using the Expo Go app, in case of Android), or to execute it with a phone emulator on the computer.
